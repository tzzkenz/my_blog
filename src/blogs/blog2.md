# Meant to be?

**Date:** April 15, 2025

“More than hope, more than faith, this is true, this is fate.”

As the lyrics of the song I love reverberate within me, my dream of singing these words with the one I love still remains out of reach. As the groups we left each other for fall apart, our song is what keeps me sane. As your face fades away from my mind, I see remnants of it in everyone, reminding me of times long gone.

Maybe all we want is to live in our own world, far from reality. Maybe all we want is to sit beside each other and have a moment of silence, far from the noisy judgments of others. Maybe all we desire is each other at the end of worlds, all for ourselves.

Perhaps holding hands in that busy street, deafened by the voice of the city, opened our eyes. Perhaps that bowl of Ramen was what really mattered. Perhaps lying on the grass in the park, singing out loud, made us realize that we’ve been going after the perfect song without realizing that there was nothing more perfect than the playful rhymes we made up. Perhaps there’s still time to fix this mess that is only ours and go back to when the grass was greener. Perhaps, we are still meant to be.

And someday, we could dance to the words “more than hope, more than faith, this is true, this fate,” like we always wanted to. Someday we can scream our love out loud from the rooftops like we always talked about. But maybe it’s never meant to be.
