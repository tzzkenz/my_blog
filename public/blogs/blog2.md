# Retro Web Design Principles

**Date:** April 15, 2025

## Embracing the Past in Modern Web Development

The web has evolved tremendously since its early days, but there's growing appreciation for the aesthetic sensibilities of the early internet era. This post explores how we can incorporate these design principles in modern websites while maintaining accessibility and usability.

### Key Elements of Retro Web Design

#### 1. Color Schemes

Early web design relied heavily on:

- **Web-safe colors** (the famous 216 color palette)
- **High contrast combinations** (often to a fault)
- **Bold primary colors** rather than subtle gradients

For example, this classic color palette:

- `#000080` - Navy Blue (often used for backgrounds)
- `#0000FF` - Blue (the default link color)
- `#551A8B` - Purple (visited links)
- `#FF0000` - Red (for emphasis and warnings)

#### 2. Typography

The classic fonts of the era:

- Times New Roman (the default serif)
- Arial (the default sans-serif)
- Courier New (for code)
- Comic Sans MS (the controversial favorite)

```css
body {
  font-family: "MS Sans Serif", Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 12px;
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

#### 3. Interface Elements

Early UI components had distinctive characteristics:

- **Beveled edges** creating a 3D effect
- **Drop shadows** that were obvious rather than subtle
- **Pixel-perfect borders** rather than smooth gradients
- **Button states** that physically appeared to depress when clicked

> "The skeuomorphic design of early GUI systems wasn't just an aesthetic choiceâ€”it was necessary to help users understand how digital interfaces worked by mimicking physical objects." - Digital Design History, 2023

## Accessibility Considerations

While embracing retro aesthetics, we must remember:

- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Ensure text remains readable
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide alternative text for images
- Test with screen readers
