# A Teenage Dream

**Date:** April 19, 2025

“Picture perfect in a broken frame, that’s how it’ll be.“

A verse that echoes as I scroll through my phone, the screen filled with blurry images of memories I swore I’d never forget. Back then, being a teenager meant chasing midnight car rides, dreaming up impossible plans, and never quite following through.

To think that all of it is over, and that all we can do is pretend, for the smallest of moments, that we are still teenagers and can do all the things we always wanted, is the dreary truth. To realize that these few years were the last flight with wings unburdened by the weight of the world, soaring freely through skies untouched by time, before responsibility clipped the edges of my dreams.

“You and me, we’re bumper cars, the more I try to get to you, the more we crash apart.“

To feel those memories being lost to time is the kind of pain that breaks our wills. To feel the weight of the distance creeping in between us, is isolation at its worst. To see our teenage dreams crash and burn in its race against time has killed what little hope remained.

Time flies; we learned that the hard way. All those years ahead of us turned into days, and then into seconds. Our teenage years really did slip away in the blink of an eye—perhaps because they were never truly ours. But did we ever stop chasing that feeling of being carefree again?

“Sunsets are beautiful, aren’t they?“

But that sunset was anything but beautiful. As the final seconds of freedom slipped away, I crossed into the threshold of adulthood—a line I’d drawn long before I was ready to face it. In that fleeting twilight, surrounded by familiar faces yet consumed by a profound loneliness, I realized there was no one left to anchor me, no hand to ease the fall. Just the slow rise of shadows, and the haunting echo of moments I let slip through my fingers, now lost to time like the sun sinking beneath the horizon.

And those blurry images stand as a sad testament to the end of a chapter—each pixel a whisper of laughter, a fleeting embrace, a dream unfulfilled. They remind me of who we were, and who we could have been, if only time hadn’t whisked us away so swiftly, leaving us to grapple with the remnants of our teenage, forever framed in a broken reality
