# Welcome to My Retro Blog

**Date:** April 17, 2025

Welcome to my blog! This is a space where I share my thoughts about retro computing, web design, and the nostalgic aesthetics of early computing systems.

## Why Retro?

There's something charming about the constraints and aesthetics of early computing:

1. Limited color palettes forced creative design decisions
2. Pixel art was necessary, not just stylistic
3. Simple interfaces often meant better usability

### My Retro Computing Setup

I'm currently running:

- Windows 98SE on an old Pentium III 500MHz
- MS-DOS 6.22 on a 486 DX2-66
- Various emulators for systems I can't physically collect

## Code Sample

Here's a simple bit of HTML that creates a retro button:

```html
<button class="win95-btn">Click Me!</button>

<style>
  .win95-btn {
    font-family: "MS Sans Serif", sans-serif;
    background: silver;
    border: 2px solid;
    border-color: #fff #000 #000 #fff;
    box-shadow: 1px 1px 0 0 #000;
    padding: 4px 10px;
  }
</style>
```
